Kyle, I unfortunately forgot to add the "are you sure you want to exit" feature. I hope I won't lose many grades because of that. If necessary I can send you a separate file with the code that would do that. It was not a problem of not know how to implement it, I just accidentally overlooked this part.

Thank you very much,
